npm is included in node.js

…………………………
from "Node.js command prompt" execute:

npx create-react-app react-app

and it creates "react-app" directory with all starter files for React.js app

note: node_module directory not uploaded to this git repo,
see also what other directories in .gitignore files  in "react-app" directory 
…………………………

npx create-react-app react-app
cd react-app
npm start

Success! Created react-app at C:\Users\je-r\react\react-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
